# Stein Fourier Analysis, some solutions

This repository stores my solutions to some problems in Stein Fourier Analysis,
I probably won't solve every questions, but only those I'm interested about.

This is a hobby project, most of the solutions (except simple ones) might refer to solutions
from the web, most probably Mathematics Stack Exchange.

Currently I record problems on Chapter 6.
